# NACHO - Tauri based Torrent Streaming Client with Content History Tracking

### Tortilla chips have always been a far superior movie snack to popcorn. Sorry, not sorry.

After the coup d'état that caused [Popcorn Time](https://github.com/popcorntime/popcorntime)'s codebase to mysteriously disappear, Nacho Time rises from the ashes as a Tauri-based torrent streaming client with built-in content history tracking.

No more dependency on Russian servers! No more shady practices! Just pure, unadulterated torrent streaming goodness.

A first version was built using the Trakt.tv API. However, trakt was only used to track watch history and get trending content. To avoid reliance on third-party services, Nacho Time now includes its own server component, [Nacho Server](https://github.com/nacho-time/nacho-time-server).

### [Nacho Server](https://github.com/nacho-time/nacho-time-server) is a required component to use Nacho. You can run it locally or use a hosted instance. If you are not a technical user, ask one of your tech-savvy friends to set one up! They can be shared by multiple users.
